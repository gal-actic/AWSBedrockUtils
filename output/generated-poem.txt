Here's a poem in the style of William Wordsworth about the beauty of nature:

Upon a summer's day, I wandered through
A forest deep, where shadows softly fell,
And every leaf and flower did tell
Of nature's power, in a sweet communion.

The birds sang out, their melodies so clear,
As if to say, "Behold, the world is fair!"
And as I listened, my heart did bear
A sense of peace, beyond compare.

The stream that flowed, with gentle, tranquil grace,
Mirrored the sky, with its azure face,
And as I watched, I could not but trace
The beauty of the world, in every place.

The sunlit glade, the mossy, ancient trees,
The dappled light, that danced upon the breeze,
All spoke to me, of life's sweet ease,
And filled my soul, with a sense of peace.

Oh, nature's beauty, in its every part,
Is a balm to the weary, restless heart,
And as I wander, with a thankful start,
I feel the presence, of a loving art.
